# Code Dojo 38 - Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a worked example in Python from the 38th London Code Dojo, whose kata was 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' - see the [README](../README.md) for more details.

The tests, written in [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html), can be run from the command-line with:

    python -m doctest rock-paper-scissors.py

Feel free to play around with it.

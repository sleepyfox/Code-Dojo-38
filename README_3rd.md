# Code Dojo 38 - part iii

## Additional feature: the Lizard-Spock expansion

For the third pomodoro The Architect informs you of an additional requirement: we must add the 'Lizard' and 'Spock' gestures. This works as follows:

> "It's very simple. Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors."

Congratulations, you've completed the Roshambo kata!
